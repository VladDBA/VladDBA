### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Vlad

 I've started working with SQL Server back in 2012 and since then I've gained the bulk of my experience in large production environments. I am a certified Data Platform MCSE with a passion for performance tunning and security. In addition to my MCSE, I am also an OSCP and PNPT. I enjoy using PowerShell to automate tasks.
